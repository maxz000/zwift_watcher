# zwift_watcher

Capture and analyze data from running Zwift client app.

With primary goal to provide actual data such as power, heart rate, cadence simultaneously for selected group of riders. 
For example, if you need to watch how all of your teammates doing.

Secondary trying to recreate and interpolate riders position on the map for given moment of time. 
Which may provide more accurate data for distance or time difference for riders in private "meetups",
automatically divide riders by groups (breakaway, peleton, gruppetto) etc.
